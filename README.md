An Emacs package to open an *external* terminal emulator in directories associated with the current buffer.


## Usage

Run `terminal-here-launch` to start a terminal in the current directory.

Recommended keybindings:

```
(require 'terminal-here)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f5>") #'terminal-here-launch)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<f6>") #'terminal-here-project-launch)
```

If the default command doesn't launch your preferred terminal you can configure
it using these three variables:

* `terminal-here-linux-terminal-command`
* `terminal-here-mac-terminal-command`
* `terminal-here-windows-terminal-command`

The documentation for these variables gives a list of terminals with builtin
support. If your terminal is in the list simply set the variable for your OS to
the terminal of your choice. e.g.

```
(setq terminal-here-linux-terminal-command 'urxvt)
(setq terminal-here-mac-terminal-command 'iterm2)
```

To use a terminal without builtin support, or to configure how your terminal is
run, you can also set the variable to a list of strings specifying the command
line which runs the terminal, e.g.

```
(setq terminal-here-linux-terminal-command '("urxvt" "-fade" "50"))
```

## Platforms

Terminal-here has out-of-the-box support for most platforms, but will work
anywhere with some customisation.

Out-of-the-box support tested on:

* Ubuntu 16.04 (but should work identically on any Debian-based system)
* Windows 10
* OSX

Should be supported out-of-the-box, but currently untested:

* Older versions of Windows
* Non-Debian-based Linux systems with a desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE)

Requires configuration before use:

* Non-Debian-based UNIXes without a desktop environment (because there is no way
  to pick a good default terminal to use).

If you have problems just configure your terminal manually as described above.


## Remote directories

`terminal-here` can run ssh to open terminals in remote directories for files
opened with [tramp](https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/#Overview). For any of
the predefined terminal configurations this should work without any configuration.

For other terminals you will need to set `terminal-here-command-flag` to the
command line flag which tells the terminal to treat the rest of the command line
as a separate command to run inside the terminal.


## Advanced configuration

To support other operating systems the variable `terminal-here-terminal-command`
can be used instead of the OS-specific variables listed above. If set it will
override other settings.

To support more complex terminals or selecting a terminal at runtime: you can
set and of the custom variables to a function which accepts a launch directory
argument and returns a list of strings specifying the command line which runs
the terminal.


## Changelog

### 2.0

* Added support for simpler customisation by setting the terminal to a symbol
  from a list of supported terminal symbols.
* Allow simple configuration of different terminals on different operating systems.
* Improved selection of a default terminal for non-Debian Linux OSes.
* Out-of-the-box support for SSH on many more terminals.


## Alternatives

There are lots of built in ways to run terminals *inside* emacs (`shell`,
`eshell`, `ansi-term`, ...) but these can have problems like slow output speed
or incompatibility with existing configs. I currently prefer to run external
terminal emulators, YMMV.

A couple of
[places on](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/7650/how-to-open-a-external-terminal-from-emacs)
[the internet](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_dired_open_file_in_ext_apps.html) have instructions for running specific terminals from Emacs, but they are not as portable as they could be.
